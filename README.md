This repository contains a set of three full Data Science projects, created with a strong focus on ___tools and methods for working with data at scale.___

The course is based on mastering tools for analyzing Big Data and large-scale datasets which have high computational demands, and are normally manipulated using a distributed cluster of machines or through statistical approximations.

This course's objective is to enable us to ___develop and implement parallel and distributed algorithms for data science applications___, and to ___apply database technologies and models___ or other relevant technologies and literature related to ___computational tools and techniques for massive data sets___.

The point of the presented Project Assignments is to consolidate the skills we have learned throughout the course through specific company case-study problems. 

In particular, we have built a ___database evaluation of anonymous customer data___ using Pandas and SQL:

* **_[Project 1 - Big Data Analytics using Pandas upon company customer databases](https://github.com/seby-sbirna/Computational-Data-Processing-using-Spark-Pandas-and-Data-Streaming/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Big%20Data%20Analytics%20using%20Pandas%20upon%20company%20customer%20databases)_**

Afterwards, we have ___analyzed a continuous web traffic stream of data___ using HyperLogLog and CountMin probabilistic data structures:

* **_[Project 2 - Web Traffic Analysis upon continuous streams of data](https://github.com/seby-sbirna/Computational-Data-Processing-using-Spark-Pandas-and-Data-Streaming/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Web%20Traffic%20Analysis%20upon%20continuous%20streams%20of%20data)_**

Lastly, we have ___collaborated using Spark on Airbnb's massive database to assess popularity of certain cities' neighbourhoods and lodging prices over time___, as well as an overall sentiment analysis upon the text reviews of lodgings in that particular city:

* **_[Project 3 - Spark Data Processing and Trend Detection from Airbnb data](https://github.com/seby-sbirna/Computational-Data-Processing-using-Spark-Pandas-and-Data-Streaming/tree/master/Project%203%20-%20Spark%20Data%20Processing%20and%20Trend%20Detection%20from%20Airbnb%20data)_**
